#Game Description

You assume the role as a little blue alien. You must destroy the enemies with your pencil farts. You have limited life that slowly regenerates over time. You can not just keep farting penciles because that is a mighty feat. So you are limited in your pencil farts by your pencil power. 

The Pencil Power not only controls the number of pencils you can fire, but it also changes the pitch of your farts. The more pencil power you have the higher the pitch of the fart and the lower the pencil power the lower the pitch of the farts. Also, the volume of the farts is determined by the amount of health the player has left.
