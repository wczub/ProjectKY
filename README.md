#Game Description

You assume the role as a little blue alien. You must destroy the enemies with your pencil farts. You have limited life that slowly regenerates over time. You can not just keep farting penciles because that is a mighty feat. So you are limited in your pencil farts by your pencil power. 

The Pencil Power not only controls the number of pencils you can fire, but it also changes the pitch of your farts. The more pencil power you have the higher the pitch of the fart and the lower the pencil power the lower the pitch of the farts. Also, the volume of the farts is determined by the amount of health the player has left. 

#Blueprints

The Blueprints Visual Scripting system in Unreal Engine is a complete gameplay scripting system based on the concept of using a node-based interface to create gameplay elements from within Unreal Editor. This system is extremely flexible and powerful as it provides the ability for designers to use virtually the full range of concepts and tools generally only available to programmers.

Through the use of Blueprints, designers can prototype, implement, or modify virtually any gameplay element, such as:

Games - set up game rules, tweak gameplay conditions, etc.
Players - create variants with different meshes and Materials or character customization.
Cameras - prototype new camera perspectives or change the camera dynamically during play.
Input - change the player controls or allow players to pass input to items.
Items - weapons, spells, pickups, triggers, etc.
Environments - create randomized props or procedurally-generated items.
